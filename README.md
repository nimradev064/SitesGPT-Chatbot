# Sites GPT Chatbot Django Application with Human Assistance

The Sites GPT Chatbot is a Django-based conversational AI application designed to provide seamless interactions with users through advanced NLP capabilities. Built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it leverages the power of the Faiss vector database to efficiently search and retrieve relevant responses from large datasets. The chatbot supports multiple file formats including PDF, Excel, Word, CSV, HTML, and website URLs, ensuring that users can input a wide range of data sources for queries. Whether itâ€™s uploading documents or sharing website links, the chatbot processes them efficiently, providing precise, context-aware responses. <br>

To enhance user experience, the system offers a Human Assistance feature. If the chatbot fails to deliver an accurate or satisfactory answer, users are provided with the option to directly connect with a human assistant. This ensures that no query goes unresolved, maintaining a high level of user satisfaction. <br>

Additionally, the chatbot interface is designed to be user-friendly, focusing on intuitive interaction for both tech-savvy and non-technical users. The integration of RAG ensures the chatbot pulls the latest, most relevant information from connected datasets, making it ideal for tasks requiring fast, real-time insights. The Faiss vector database enables high-speed similarity search, improving the quality of the responses by ranking relevant content accurately. This chatbot is perfect for businesses, research teams, and knowledge management platforms seeking an efficient, AI-powered solution for automated queries with a robust human fallback system. <br>
